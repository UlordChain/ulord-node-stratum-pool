ulord=Ulord is a peer-to-peer value delivery public chain that enables third-party developers to explore their own applications over their open-source agreements by building blockchain infrastructure and digital resource distribution protocols and creates with many industry partners a complete ecology of blockchain technology and applications. Based on various rules and protocols created by Ulord, it grants various types of digital resource application scenarios including text, pictures, music, video and software, providing a direct docking platform for information creators and consumers.

faq1c=Ulord is a decentralized content distribution platform that provides content distribution in public chain based on blockchain technology, creates a complete ecosystem for content distribution by creative work, where people can create a wide variety of content-based decentralized applications, such as video, music, pictures, text, code, animation material, etc., and thus by taking advantage of the smart contract it ensures content creators and communicators get the corresponding benefits.
faq2c=Ulord aims to reshape the benefits distribution in the content distribution system by a decentralized way. The traditional content distribution process determined by the publisher (or other centralized organizations, platforms, channels)  is about to changed. Take book publication For example, the author's royalty rate is usually between 7-15%, paper costs about 10%, so where is the rest value? It flows to interests chain which has been formed in the intermediate links, while the emergence of Ulord will completely change the situation.
faq3c=The original authors and content consumers directly dock on Ulord to remove the centralized agency profits and fully ensure the interests of original authors.
faq4c=Consumers can search their favorite content and authors on the platform, purchase content, score and comment on the purchased content to determine the status and quality of premium content.
faq5c=In the Internet era, everyone is a disseminator of content, and has the right to express views, comment, distribute or reprint content. Thus the time and effort taken on Ulord can also be paid to encourage the provision and disseminate the good content.
faq6c=UlordToken is the coin on the Ulord platform, and it cannot be added or destroyed. UlordToken is used to pay for on Ulord. The rational distribution of UlordToken helps to promote the healthy development of Ulord ecosystem.
faq7c=Owning UlordToken means joining the Ulord community, the ecological value of the community is promoted through co-working between community members and users. There are five ways to get UlordTokens:1.CPU computing resources involves in accounting;2.Server nodes participate in network infrastructure construction;3.Publish original internet content;4.Spread valuable internet content;5.Community promotion and code contribution
