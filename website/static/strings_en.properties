question1 = 1. Ulord Overview
answer1 = Ulord is a peer-to-peer value delivery public chain that enables third-party developers to explore their own applications over their open-source agreements by building blockchain infrastructure and digital resource distribution protocols and creates with many industry partners a complete ecology of blockchain technology and applications. Based on various rules and protocols created by Ulord, it grants various types of digital resource application scenarios including text, pictures, music, video and software, providing a direct docking platform for information creators and consumers.
question2 = 2. How is the revenue calculated?
answer2 = Current testnet generates blocks every 2.5minutes, 576 blocks per day, about 112 tULDs per block, halving every four years.
question3 = 3. What is the required configuration for mining?
answer3 = Ulord supports CPU mining and it requires no other high-end configurations nor it requires fixed IPs.
question4 = 4. How to fill the pool node?
answer4 = Pool name: test-pool.ulord.one    Port number: 7200
question5 = 5. Download address of Ulord mining tool.
answer5 = , this is the download address on official website.
question6 = 6. Which system versions have the corresponding mining tools?
answer6 = Windows (win7 and win10) 64-bit systems, Linux 64-bit systems (ubuntu16.4, contos7.3-1611).
question7 = 7. How to connect to the mining pool?
answer7 = In Windows system, enter the folder where the tool is located, modify the config.json configuration file and save it, double-click the start.sh file to start mining. In Linux system, enter the folder where the tool is located, use the command ./minerd -c config.json to start mining (config.json is the configuration file, which can be modified).
question8 = 8. How to modify config.json file, and what need to modify？
answer8 = Under normal circumstances, you only need to change the address in the file to the address of your own wallet, and change thread count to what you want.
question9 = 11. Windows mining rig (mining tools) lacks the number of CPU cores, and the number of processes.
answer9 = You can add "threads" : "x" to your config.json file (x indicates the number of cores for mining calls).
question10 = 13. The full-node wallet has been digging for several days without digging out any block, and why?
answer10 = The full-node wallet mining is solo mining. Because of the low hash power, the probability of digging out block is low. In order to obtain a stable income, it is recommended to download the mining software for mining.
question11 = 14. Why does cpuminer mining tool fail to operate? 
answer11 = The problem is caused by various reasons. The processor may be incompatible or the system environment may not be compatible. The new mining tools are being debugged and are expected to be shared within a week.
